Project for NSM, Multiclass Classifier Model on UNSW NB15 Dataset
PROJECT:: Design & development of anomaly based NIDS framework using UNSW-NB 15 dataset

UNSW-NB15 Dataset:: The raw network packets of the UNSW-NB 15 dataset was created by the IXIA PerfectStorm tool in the Cyber Range Lab of UNSW Canberra for generating a hybrid of real modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviours. The tcpdump tool was utilised to capture 100 GB of the raw traffic (e.g., Pcap files). This dataset has nine types of attacks, namely, Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms. The Argus, Bro-IDS tools are used and twelve algorithms are developed to generate totally 49 features with the class label.
 
The details about dataset can be accessed using the following LINK: https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset

   i)     Training Set::  UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv
   ii)     Test Set:: UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv
   iii)    Features description::  UNSW-NB15_features.csv


Project's objectives::

a) Design a NIDS framework(classfier model) based on Machine Learning(ML), Deep Learning(DL) or Natural Language Processing(NLP) based algorithms. Any of the ML/DL based frameworks such as Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook etc., may be used to build and test the classifier model. The model has to be trained on the "Training Set" data and then the trained model has to be evaluated on the "Test Set" data.  If you require more computational resources, you can apply for the department's HPC containers. However, containers' allotment are subjected to their availability.

b) Use standard IEEE template to write the project's write-up. The templates (Microsoft Word and Latex) are available at : https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html

c) The write-up should have the following sections in the order mentioned below:

   i)      Abstract
   ii)     Introduction
   iii)     Related Work & Background studies
   iv)     Description of Proposed Framework
   v)      Experimental Results
   vi)     Conclusion
   vii)    References
